 * Finite field functions (GF(9767^19)).
 *
 * Each field element is represented as an array of 19 uint16_t values.
 * Exact contents are implementation-specific.
 *
 * IMPORTANT RULES:
 *
 *  - All arrays must be 32-bit aligned (for architectures that enforce
 *    32-bit alignment), even though they only contain 16-bit values.
 *    The caller is expected to ensure alignment, e.g. with a union
 *    type. The type field_element below can be used to that effect,
 *    especially for local variables.
 *
 *  - For functions that receive field elements as parameters and return
 *    field elements, the destination array may be the same as any of
 *    the source arrays; but partial overlap is not supported.
 *
 *  - All the functions defined in this API are fully constant-time.
 *    This applies even when array contents are indeterminate (i.e.
 *    timing-based side channels will not reveal anything about source
 *    array contents even if they are not valid).
 *
 *  - For the "conditional functions" (*condneg(), *select3()), the
 *    control value MUST be in the defined range (e.g. 0, 1 or 2 for
 *    *select3()); no other value is supported.
